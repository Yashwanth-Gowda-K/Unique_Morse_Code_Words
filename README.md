Unique Morse Code Words
ðŸ”  Convert words to Morse code and count unique representations

Description
This Python solution converts a list of words into their Morse code equivalents and counts how many unique Morse code patterns exist.

Problem Statement
Given an array of words, each word is converted to Morse code where:
Each letter is replaced by its Morse representation (e.g., 'a' â†’ ".-").
The full Morse code for a word is the concatenation of each letter's Morse code.
The goal is to count the number of unique Morse code representations among all words.



python
words = ["gin", "zen", "gig", "msg"]
Morse Code Conversions:

"gin" â†’ "--...-."

"zen" â†’ "--...-."

"gig" â†’ "--...--."

"msg" â†’ "--...--."

Output: 2 (Only 2 unique Morse patterns: "--...-." and "--...--.")
